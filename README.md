# Notification Count
## Android Xposed Module for adding a number to notification icons (e.g. Message count)

### Origin of this module
The original author of this Mod is *bbukowski* (https://github.com/bbukowski).
This is a fork of https://github.com/bbukowski/NotifCount/ to keep developing, as the original author seems to have discontinued development (last commit mid 2014).
I will create a pull request for the changes for a possible merge into the original repo, if the original developer would like to continue.
*Info:* The last recent master state of the original repo is not functional, as it crashes in `InitZygote` due to a not found class.

### Support for this module
Bug reports, feature requests, questions, etc.:
**XDA Developers** thread:
(coming soon)

Also feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you want.

### Mod information
This module currently has the following abilities:
- Enable the Android-built-in functionality to add a number to notifications which provide Android a number, e.g. Messaging apps (like Telegram)

More features related to this function may be added in the future.

### Source informarion
The original developer did not provide any licensing information.
I assume that he is ok with forking his work.
